      <h1>For Sale: My <em>Prized</em> Shoe collection</h1>
    
      <p>Hello! I will be selling my prized shoe collection. I have spent years
        accumulating these shoes and many of them are quite <em>valuable</em>.
      </p>

     <h2>Why I Am selling my collection:</h2>
      <p>
        Selling my collection of shoes was not an easy decision for me to 
        make because it took a lot of time and effort to collect all of
        these shoes. The reason that I have decided to sell my collection 
        is to pay for my college tuiton. I came to the conclusion that the
        only way to cover it was to let go of my collection that is made up
        of many <em>high value</em> sneakers such as the Jordan 1 Retros, Nike Dunks,
        Yeezy 350s, and many more.
      </p>
      <h2>The details of my collection:</h2>
      <p>This collection of shoes is made up of some of the most sought after
        shoes from the past 10 years, including brands like Nike, Adidas, 
        Jordan, Reebok, and more. All of these shoes have been kept in <em>pristine
        condition</em> and include the box that they originally came with.
      </p>
      <p>If you are interested in buying my collection, please feel free
        to reach out for more details and discuss prices. I hope that whoever
        becomes the new owner of this collection finds as much value and appreciation
        for this collection as I have.
